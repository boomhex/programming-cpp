The reason that the destructor is never called is because the object is never 
completely constructed. While constructing Demo, a value is thrown. This 
exception reaches the function-try-block and makes the contruction fail. This
also makes the exception rethrow it automaticly, this is why main catches it 
aswell. Because of the failed construction there is no object to destruct.

When moving the try-block inside the constructor it does construct. this is 
because the exception is chatched and handled inside the constructor. This 
makes the object completely construct and calls the destructor on desctruction.

This destruction happens when the object goes out of scope, the location in our 
case is the closing bracked of the main try block. This is the loaction where 
the destructor is called.

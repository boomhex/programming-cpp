Explain why exit calls should be avoided in C++ programs, and why exceptions are a better alternative.

exit() calls should be avoided because:

1. They terminate the program directly allowing no opportunity for the program to recover from a non-fatal disastrous event

2. Because the program terminates directly, the destructors of local objects are not automatically called,
leading to resource leaks (violating the RAII paradigm)

3. It is bad design to use them in libraries. A library shouldn't terminate the whole program.

For example:

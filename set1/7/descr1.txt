This exercise introduces the technique of extending a class with
manipulator-like functionality using overloaded function-call operators. The
Strings class is change such that its output format can be changed dynamically
inside a single stream expression by setting separators or custom callback
functions. A user can select simple textual separators or supply a free
function that controls how each string is inserted. The assignment demonstrates
how to combine operator overloading, stateful insertion logic, and function
pointers to achieve flexible, reusable output behavior.

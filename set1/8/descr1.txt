This program defines a Strings class that manages a dynamic collection of
std::string objects using reference counting to share and reuse data
efficiently. To support copy-on-write behavior when elements change, it
introduces a nested Proxy class that represents a reference to one stored
string. Only Strings may construct Proxy objects, ensuring controlled
access to shared data. The Proxy type also supports stream insertion,
allowing its referenced string to be printed directly.

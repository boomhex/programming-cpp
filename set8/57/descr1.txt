The Semaphore class maintains an internal counter representing the number of 
available permits and uses a mutex plus a condition variable so that wait() 
blocks whenever the counter is zero. When another thread calls notify() or 
notify_all(), the counter is incremented and waiting thread(s) are signaled 
so one thread can re-acquire the mutex, decrement the counter, and continue.

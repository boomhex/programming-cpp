This program starts and supervises an external program that prints output at
fixed intervals. It creates a child process using fork() and starts the
external program in the child using execl(), while the parent monitors its
execution. A separate waiter thread waits for the child process to terminate
and signals the main thread using a semaphore. The main thread waits either
until the child finishes or until an optional timeout expires, in which case
the child process is forcibly terminated using kill(2). Before exiting, the
program joins all threads, reaps the child process, and reports whether the
program ended normally or due to a timeout.

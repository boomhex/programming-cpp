1.	Parse arguments and options
The program reads configuration such as the number of compilation threads (N) and a
temporary directory location. If the user specifies 0 threads, it is silently
replaced by 1. The program then constructs the required objects (source provider,
job queue, compiler configuration, workers).
2.	Create and manage the temporary directory
A TempDir object ensures the directory exists (create if missing) and guarantees
removal at program termination (also when compilation fails). Object files and
compiler stderr capture files are placed in this directory.
3.	Discover sources and enqueue compilation work
A SourceProvider produces source filenames (e.g., from a list file or directory
traversal). For each source file, the program determines a corresponding object file
path in the temp directory and creates a compile task. Tasks are pushed into a shared
TaskQueue.
4.	Compile concurrently using workers
N worker threads are started. Each worker repeatedly pops one task from the queue
and executes it. Each task runs the compiler for exactly one source file and returns
a CompileResult indicating success or failure, plus captured stderr information.
5.	Stop
If any worker observes a failed compilation, it atomically signals a stop flag,
records the first failure (including the error output location/text), and wakes all
workers. Remaining queued tasks are not compiled, and workers terminate after they
notice the stop condition.
6.	Join workers
The main thread joins all worker threads. If a failure was recorded, only the error
output of the first failing compilation is printed. Otherwise, the program reports
success. Finally, the temp directory is removed by RAII cleanup.

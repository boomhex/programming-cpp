The program defines a base and derived class, showcasing how a caller function
can take a Base class object, calling the derived class's data member.
The provided caller function calls hello() from derived, after recasting a Base
class object to a Derived class. This is unreccommended, since this only works
when obj really points to a Base class object. Another object will have
undefined behavior when attempting this.

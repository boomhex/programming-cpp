When using placement new, or in the context of unrestricted unions,
explicit destructor calls are encountered. Explain why code using 
such explicit destructor calls for objects of a class Derived, which 
was derived from Base doesn't have to call explicitly the Base class's 
destructor: 

It is not needed to explicitly call the Base class's destructor, because
C++ guarantees us that when the destructor of a class is called 
(explicitly or automatically) it releases all the alocated memory
(including that of all it's base classes)

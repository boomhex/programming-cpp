When we create an object of derived class, all of the members of said class
must be initialized but the inherited members in derived class can only be 
initialized by the base class constructor. This is why the constructor of base
class is called first to initialize all the inherited members. 

Since the derived class is constructed on top of the base class, the derived destructor
is called first, only then is the base destructor called.

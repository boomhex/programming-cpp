When a class Derived inherits publically from another class Base, the user of
derived can access the base class's public members, the designer of derived
can access both the public and protected members of class Base.
When using protected inheritance, the user of Derived cannot access any members
from Base. The designer can access public and protected members again.
When using private inheritance, a user can access none of Base class's members,
the designer can use public and private members again.

The difference between protected and private inheritance is that in protecteed,
protected and public members from Base become protected in Derived. While in
private inheritance, members become private in Derived.

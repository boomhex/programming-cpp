Inheriting a WIP class in some class OpusMagnus causes that OpusMagnus' layout
contains the complete WIP object. Meaning that changes in WIP, result in any
applications of OpusMagnus to be recompiled because of a break in ABI. So,
inheriting from a class that might still be changed causes ABI breakage in any
inheriting class, when said class is changed. Making the implementation
extremely coupled.

Using composition (by-value) in the example has the same problem. Since WIP is
still apart of OpusMagnus' interface, changing data members implementation in 
WIP still causes ABI breakage in OpusMagnus.

A solution would be to use PIMPL approach covered in block I. Now OpusMagnus'
layout only stores a pointer to WIP. Changing the implementation of WIP's 
data members, does not change OpusMagnus' layout, since this remains merely a
pointer to WIP.
Example:
class OpusMagnus
{
    WIP *d_wip;
    ...
};

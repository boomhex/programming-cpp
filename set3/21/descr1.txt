The reason it is bad practice to inherit string as a base class is because the
class was never designed to act as a base class. It has no virtual destructor 
and no virtual interface, which makes polymorphic use unsafe and can lead to 
undefined behavior when a derived object is deleted through a std::string*. 
Since the internal implementation of std::string is not meant to be altered, 
overriding or extending its behavior through inheritance may cause unexpected 
results and break assumptions relied on by the standard library. Inheriting 
from std::string also weakens encapsulation by exposing implementation details
that the class is intended to hide.

The String class publicly derives from std::string and adds one extra
convenience function. It provides an insert member that prepends a given text
to the existing string content. All standard std::string constructors and
insert overloads remain available through using declarations.

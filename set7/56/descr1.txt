This program reads a text file once per task and counts four character 
categories: vowels (upper and lower case), digits, hexadecimal digits, and 
punctuation characters. A TaskThreads controller runs these four Task objects 
either in parallel using std::thread (default) or sequentially when an extra 
command-line argument is provided, then prints each count with its label and 
reports the total runtime.

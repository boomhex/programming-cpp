This exercise defines two classes, Handler and Processor, each of which uses
the enum Msg internally.
To avoid duplicating the enum and to keep it accessible only to the members of
these classes, the enum is placed in a small base class.
Both classes privately inherit from this base, giving them access to Msg
without exposing it in their public interfaces.

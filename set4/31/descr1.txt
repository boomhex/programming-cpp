This program defines an abstract base class Fork that encapsulates the
common logic of the Unix fork() system call using the Template Method
design pattern. The class offers a public member fork() that creates a
child process and then calls parentProcess() in the parent and
childProcess() in the child. Derived classes override these virtual
functions to specify the behaviour in each process, while the base class
handles process creation, PID management and waiting for the child.

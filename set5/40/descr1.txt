This program implements the Lines class, which reads successive blocks
of non-empty lines from an input file and associates each block with the
Lines object constructed from that stream position.

Although Lines objects have no data members, the read lines are stored
in a shared registry keyed by object identity and construction order.
This allows an object to return its own lines via get() and the lines
of the idx-th constructed object via get(idx).

When a Lines object is destroyed, its associated data are removed from
the registry so later queries return an empty result, ensuring no memory
leaks.

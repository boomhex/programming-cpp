This program reads all words from standard input and ensures uniqueness
by first storing them in a set. The unique words are then copied into a 
vector, after which an additional word is appended. If there is enough 
capacity, then the size is +1 and the capacity stays the same else the 
capacity is doubled and size is still +1.

To remove this excess capacity in a guaranteed manner, the program
creates a temporary copy of the object and swaps it with the original,
thereby replacing the oversized storage with a compact one. It
demonstrates how excess capacity can be shed guaranteed.

shrink_to_fit() should not be used here because it is non-binding.
It request to shrink it, but the implementation does not guarantee 
that it actually shrinks the vector.
